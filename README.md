## This is the creation of the tours pages, and the subsequent pages for each country's tour information. All are made to link to one another and be responsive.


Our objectives for this particular webpage were to:

Practice how to make your site responsive

Set up a base that we can use for our future pages to keep them looking connected with the header and footer.

Create identical pages at a base and then customize them to be accurate to the reference with seperate pictures. 

Link pages together to create a functioning home tours page.

I made these webpages by first creating the tours page first, and then creating the clones of each tour page respectively. Then, I used the formatting for the header and footer from the previous pages I've done to keep the pages formatted correctly. Lastly, I took all the cloned tour pages and updated the pictures to be correct to the refernce.
